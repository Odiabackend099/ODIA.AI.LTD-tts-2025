# Planning: Repository Cleanup and RunPod Preparation

## Problem Statement
Analyze current repository state, remove confusing/conflicting files, implement fixes, and prepare for RunPod web terminal deployment. Repository needs to be clean and production-ready.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Repository Analysis
- **Goal**: Understand current state and identify issues
- **Tasks**:
  1. Analyze current folder structure
  2. Identify confusing or conflicting files
  3. Check for missing essential files
  4. Document current state
- **Success Criteria**: Clear understanding of repository state and issues

### Phase 2: Cleanup and Fixes
- **Goal**: Remove conflicts and implement necessary fixes
- **Tasks**:
  1. Remove confusing/conflicting files
  2. Restore essential files if missing
  3. Fix any broken configurations
  4. Ensure clean structure
- **Success Criteria**: Clean repository with no conflicts

### Phase 3: RunPod Preparation
- **Goal**: Prepare repository for RunPod deployment
- **Tasks**:
  1. Ensure RunPod-compatible structure
  2. Add deployment scripts if needed
  3. Verify all dependencies are clear
  4. Test deployment readiness
- **Success Criteria**: Repository ready for RunPod deployment

### Phase 4: GitHub Push
- **Goal**: Push clean repository to GitHub
- **Tasks**:
  1. Commit all changes
  2. Push to GitHub
  3. Verify push success
  4. Confirm repository is accessible
- **Success Criteria**: Clean repository pushed to GitHub

## Technical Requirements

### Repository Structure Requirements
- Clean folder structure
- No conflicting files
- Essential files present
- RunPod-compatible layout

### RunPod Requirements
- Clear deployment instructions
- Proper dependency management
- Environment configuration
- Production-ready code

### GitHub Requirements
- Clean git history
- Proper .gitignore
- Security measures in place
- Documentation complete

## Testing Criteria

### Repository Analysis Tests
- All files identified and categorized
- Conflicts and issues documented
- Missing files identified

### Cleanup Tests
- Conflicting files removed
- Essential files restored
- Structure is clean

### RunPod Preparation Tests
- Deployment scripts work
- Dependencies are clear
- Configuration is correct

### GitHub Push Tests
- Push completes successfully
- Repository is accessible
- All changes are committed

## Dependencies and Assumptions

### Dependencies
- Current repository files
- RunPod deployment environment
- GitHub repository access

### Assumptions
- RunPod needs minimal, clean repository
- Conflicting files cause deployment issues
- Clean git history is required

## Risk Mitigation
- If files are missing, restore from backup
- If conflicts exist, remove conflicting versions
- If deployment fails, check RunPod requirements
- If push fails, check git configuration
